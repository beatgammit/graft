graft [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/beatgammit/graft/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/beatgammit/graft/latest)
==========

`graft` is reflection library based on JSONPatch to patch objects in place.

`graft` is under development, so there are no guarantees about backwards compatibility, stability or even usefulness. Use at your own risk.

Status
======

The following operations are implemented:

* add
* remove
* replace
* test

The following still need to be done:

* copy
* move

Since this is still in early development, there are plenty of bugs and the operations are overly strict.

Contributing
============

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please make sure to run `gofmt` on your code with default options.
